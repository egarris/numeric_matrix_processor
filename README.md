# Numeric Matrix Processor

This is a program that performs basic operations on numeric matrices. It can add, subtract, multiply, transpose and find the inverse and determinant. Yes, NumPy would've made this **much** easier, but that wasn't the point! This one required me to dust off math I haven't used in years. It's the 8th project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track.

I've also started working through UC Berkeley's [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp20/), most of which is available to the public online. I tried to implement what I'm learning about functional abstraction, environments and documentation where possible. Overall I'd say I did a much better job of documenting the code I wrote here compared to the previous projects. I know I could refactor some of this code to make it easier to comprehend, but time constraints kept me from doing so. Going forward, I'd like to write unit tests as much as possible.

Topics covered include:

- Linear Algebra
- Recursion
- Algorithms in Python
- OOP
